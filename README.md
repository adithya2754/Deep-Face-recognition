# Deep-Face-recognition


This code helps in facial recognition using facenets. The concept of facenets was originally presented in a research paper. The main concepts talked about triplet loss function to compare images of different person. This concept uses inception network which has been taken from source and fr_utils.py is taken from deeplearning.ai for reference. I have added several functionalities of my own for providing stability and better detection.

# Description

A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiples methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database.

# Functionalities added

Detecting face only when your eyes are opened.
Using face align functionality from dlib to predict effectively while live streaming.
